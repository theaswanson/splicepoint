              What inspired you to start Splicepoint and make videos for

            <p>
              A combination of factors. I always liked technology and for
              whatever reason really enjoyed running around the neighborhood in
              the 90s with our neighbors and my parents old camcorder. I used to
              shoot on HI-8 tapes (I still have a few). Most of the oldest stuff
              was "in-camera" editing where you'd rewind and tape over sections
              to sequence things right. When "editing" started, I was working
              from old capture cards and had to manually "record" the camera
              playback by hooking up RCA cables to a card slotted into the
              motherboard. Had a couple of great art teachers in high school and
              a school "film festival" that kept it alive (and some great
              friends, many who "star" in the nerf videos - who enjoyed doing it
              together).

              The initial Nerf assassination video is ripped straight from the
              movie
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooter_(2007_film)"
                target="_blank"
                >Shooter</a
              >; the dialogue is almost one-for-one. These days, I'm not sure
              the Nerf Assassination videos in a local park or on a college
              campus would be a smart choice, given the culture around gun
              violence on campuses. For the Nerf videos, I used to "scout"
              locations and then draw a birdseye sketch of buildings with Xs and
              Os for myself to choreograph everything, then tell our 'actors'
              where to be when. Sometimes it'd be like 6 pieces of letter paper
              taped together, looked like a Charlie Day meme.

              YouTube used to be a lot more "home video" and way less
              professional & semi-professional content creator. Hard to
              describe, but we didn't really set out to make a "community" we
              just enjoyed sharing stuff that we made. It's definitely a
              different world now.

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I don't remember the model of camcorders, but we then moved on to
              my parents' camcorder that shot on the Mini-DV format, and
              ultimately digital. If I was shooting today, I think there's a lot
              that could be done on my DSLR or even on a stabilized iPhone. The
              equipment was never great. I can't remember the exact camera I
              used during college, but I had a terrible mini-shotgun mic mounted
              on the hot-shoe. Audio was always a problem. These days there are
              awesome solutions I would use that could improve quality. I had
              great editing software though. Mostly used Adobe Premier but had
              experience with others. People under-estimate what you can do with
              something as basic as iMovie; but I was actually planning to
              double major in film in college and ended up dropping it to a
              minor and finishing college a semester early. I enjoyed the
              post-production part more than anything, always have.

            <p>
              I don't do much videography as a hobby anymore, but I've always
              been a "million hobbies" kind of person. Photography, 3D Printing,
              Woodworking, I have a laser cutter, ran a D&D campaign with some
              of my oldest friends for a while. Now that we have kids, a lot of
              my creative efforts go into creating things with them for fun. If
              I had the free time, it'd be fun to make a new Nerf video just to
              see how well we could do with modern tools (drones, stabilizers),
              a bigger "budget" (adult incomes rather than college life).

              It depends on 'why' you're making it. You're your own worst
              critic. Do it for yourself first, enjoy the process - the best
              part was awesome memories with many people I don't see regularly
              anymore. Everyone is a critic on the Internet, it's amazing what
              the reception has been, but it was never really the goal. Later
              on, we had a couple of different podcasts (now no longer paying to
              have them hosted), like a video game book club type thing with a
              very brief stint of Twitch live recording, and it really helped me
              appreciate just how much work it is for successful "content
              creators" to do what they do professionally. Social media,
              scheduling posts, interacting with your community, setting up
              streams, editing time, etc. It's a full-time job and then some.
              Creating things is just buried somewhere inside of me. I find
              satisfaction building a bird house in the garage, organizing my
              fly fishing gear, 3D printing a part I modeled in TinkerCAD that
              makes a buddy's coffee mug fit better under his coffee machine,
              etc. Looks like you're a software developer, I'm an accountant.
              It's nice to create/make stuff. I find immense satisfaction
              understanding how things work and even enjoy working on my house.

              Great question. I'll consider it; in full candor - some of it is
              just hard to watch your younger self and be exposed to the public.
              I love messages and people who reach out like this though. I can
              never believe the reach/effect we've had. I had a pair of brothers
              from Germany reach out a couple years back and it blew me away.
